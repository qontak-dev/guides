# Testing

* Prefer `eq` to `==` in RSpec.
* Separate setup, excercise, verification, and teardown phases with newlines. [[sample]](https://github.com/qontak-dev/guides/blob/master/style/testing/four_phase_test.md)

# Factories

* Order factories.rb contents: sequences, traits, factory definitions.
* Order factory attributes: implicit attributes, explicit attributes, child factory definitions. Each section's attributes are alphabetical.
* Order factory definitions alphabetically by factory name.
* Use one factories.rb file per project.
